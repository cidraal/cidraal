    <summary><h3>📝 My Journey with Coding</h3></summary>
    I'm currently a 15 year old student in High-school and I'm a part of a Technical program in Systems Development. An ambitious learner and hope to work in the software engineering field. Started learning about programming in 2024, but other things i've accomplished is competing in international competitions based on writing essays, and was rewarded with three exclusive courses about coding. I'm fluent in both portuguese and english, with more than 4 years of experience in comunicating with natives of english based countries. Also currently in the middle of 8 programming and web development courses and a college level math course. I dream of working for an international company and one day go live in the US, and with a few years of experience I hope to then start my own company.
